    <p>Dear Dr. O'Moaney,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

    <h2>Popular Programming Languages</h2>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my career in software development, I have explored various programming languages. To answer your question, my favorite programming languages are as follows, with definitions:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Python</dt>
    <dd>Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python's syntax emphasizes code readability, making it a favorite among both beginners and experienced developers.</dd>

    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
    <dd>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level language primarily used for enhancing web pages by making them interactive. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables dynamic content and is used in server-side development as well, thanks to environments like Node.js.</dd>

    <dt>Rust</dt>
    <dd>Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. Developed by Mozilla, it provides fine-grained control over system resources while ensuring safety from common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. Rust is increasingly popular for building high-performance and reliable software.</dd>
